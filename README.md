# JoBSS Ice Seal Survey Data Management

This repository stores the code associated with managing JoBSS survey data. Code numbered 0+ are intended to be run sequentially as the data are available for processing. Code numbered 99 are stored for longetivity, but are intended to only be run once to address a specific issue or run as needed, depending on the intent of the code.

The Datasheets folder contains the KAMERA-specific datasheets for JoBSS surveys.

The data management processing code is as follows:
* **JoBSS_01_Import2DB.R** - code to import data from the network into the DB
* **JoBSS_01_ProcessFootprints2DB.R** - code to import footprints (from post-processing) into the DB
* **JoBSS_02a_MarkNUCedIRimages.R** - code to mark IR images as NUC (after they have been run through BXH processing)
* **JoBSS_02b_AssignFinalIRNUC.txt** - code to make final NUC call based on the processing approach
* **JoBSS_03a_ProcessEffortReconciled.txt** - code to create/update effort_reconciled field based on review of data (to correct any incorrect assignments)
* **JobSS_03b_CreateFlightLines.txt** - code to create flight lines from point records
* **JoBSS_04_PrepareManualReviewImages.R** - code to generate list of images for manual review
* **JoBSS_05_ProcessDetectorOutputData_with20210726_batchProcessing.R** - processes the original (before review) detection data from JoBSS imagery into the PEP database
* **JoBSS_06_ImportProcessedIR2DB_with20210726_batchProcessing.R** - processes the reviewed IR detection data from the JoBSS imagery into the PEP database
* **JoBSS_07_SetRandomOrderAndQuartileBreaks_with20210726_batchProcessing.R** - after the IR detection data are imported, identifies quantile breaks in the data, which are important for processing steps
* **JoBSS_08a_ImportProcessedRGB2DB_with20210726_batchProcessing.R** - processed the reviewed RGB detection data from the JoBSS imagery into the PEP database
* **JoBSS_08b_MatchBoundingBoxes.Rmd** - matches the IR detections to the RGB detections, since the data do not share a common identifier; the outputs from this processing still need to be evaluated by biologists for identifying the "best" approach moving forward
* **JoBSS_09_ImportProcessedUV2DB_with20210726_batchProcessing.R** - processed the reviewed UV detection data from the JoBSS imagery into the PEP database
* **JoBSS_10_ProcessDetectionShp2DB.R** - code to import seal detection locations into the DB
